## 🧠 OMNI Context System

**ALWAYS read these files BEFORE generating or modifying code:**

1. **`.omni/context/project-structure.json`** - Current project state with versioning
2. **`.omni/memory/short_term.json`** - Recent changes and active context
3. **`.omni/context/*.md`** - Architecture and design decisions

### Why Use OMNI Context?

- **Token efficiency**: Reduces context size by ~83%
- **Accurate information**: Always up-to-date project structure
- **Avoid duplication**: Check existing classes/functions before creating new ones
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow established patterns and naming conventions

### Before Writing Code:

1. Read `.omni/context/project-structure.json` to understand:
   - Existing files and their purposes
   - Class/function signatures
   - Dependencies between modules
   - Recent changes (check `change_history`)

2. Check `.omni/memory/short_term.json` for:
   - Active tasks
   - Recent modifications
   - Current focus areas

3. Review relevant `.omni/context/*.md` files for domain understanding

## Project Overview

**Project Type:** Software Project
**Languages:** PHP, TypeScript, Python, JavaScript

## Code Style & Conventions

- Use descriptive variable names
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

## Security Requirements

When generating code, ALWAYS:

- Use parameterized queries (never string concatenation for SQL)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Never hardcode secrets, passwords, or API keys
- Use secure authentication patterns
- Apply proper authorization checks
- Escape output to prevent XSS

## ⚠️ Known Security Issues (Fix These!)

- **[MEDIUM]** 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192' in position 156: character maps to <undefined>
- **[MEDIUM]** 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192' in position 1367: character maps to <undefined>
- **[CRITICAL]** Potential security issue detected
